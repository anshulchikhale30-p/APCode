# ⚡ APCode

### Offline-first AI coding agent for your terminal.

**APCode** is a lightweight, developer-focused AI coding agent that runs directly inside your terminal.
It understands your project, works with local models, provides an interactive TUI, and is designed to make AI-assisted development possible even on modest hardware.

> **Your terminal. Your code. Your model. Your agent.**

## 🖥️ What is APCode?

APCode turns your terminal into an **AI coding workspace**.

Instead of repeatedly switching between:

```text
Terminal
   ↓
Editor
   ↓
AI Chat
   ↓
Terminal
   ↓
Documentation
```

APCode brings the interaction into one place:

```text
                 ┌──────────────────────┐
                 │       APCode         │
                 │   AI Coding Agent    │
                 └──────────┬───────────┘
                            │
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
              ↓             ↓             ↓
          Your Code       Tools         Models
              │             │             │
              └─────────────┼─────────────┘
                            ↓
                     Project Changes
```

Ask APCode to understand, analyze, modify, or test your project.

Enter ↵ send                         ollama · Qwen2.5-Coder 7B Q4
```

The interface is designed to stay **clean, readable, and keyboard-first**.

# 🧠 What makes APCode different?

### ⚡ Terminal-native

No heavyweight desktop application.

APCode lives where developers already work:

```text
Terminal
```

### 📴 Local-first

APCode is designed around local inference.

Use local models through supported runtimes instead of requiring every coding request to leave your machine.

### 💻 Hardware-aware

APCode detects your environment and can help determine what model your machine can realistically run.

```text
CPU
RAM
GPU
VRAM
Runtime
Model
```

### 🧩 Project-aware

APCode detects information about the project you're working inside.

For example:

```text
Go · 126 files · Git: main
```

or:

```text
Python · 24 files · Git: clean
```

### 🎨 Modern TUI

APCode isn't just a collection of commands.

It provides:

* Interactive prompt
* Project context
* Model indicator
* Command palette
* Agent activity
* Status information
* Spinners
* Semantic output
* Responsive terminal layouts

---

# 🤖 AI Coding Workflow

A typical workflow looks like:

```text
       User
        │
        │  "Fix the login bug"
        ▼
   ┌───────────┐
   │   APCode  │
   └─────┬─────┘
         │
         ▼
  Detect project
         │
         ▼
   Inspect files
         │
         ▼
   Search relevant code
         │
         ▼
     AI reasoning
         │
         ▼
   Plan modification
         │
         ▼
    Edit files
         │
         ▼
      Run tests
         │
         ▼
     Show result
```

The goal is simple:

> **Tell APCode what you want. Let the agent handle the development workflow.**

PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshulchikhale30-p/APCode/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then:

```powershell
apcode
```

---

## Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshulchikhale30-p/APCode/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then:

```bash
apcode
```

---

## Go

If you already have Go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/anshulchikhale30-p/APCode/cmd/apcode@latest
```

Then:

```bash
apcode
```

---

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshulchikhale30-p/APCode.git
cd APCode

go build -o apcode ./cmd/apcode
```

Run:

```bash
./apcode
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\apcode.exe
```

---

# 🎮 Commands

Start the interactive workspace:

```bash
apcode
```

Useful commands:

```text
/help
/models
/recommend
/status
/benchmark
/clear
/exit
```

You can also use the direct CLI commands:

```bash
apcode --version

apcode models

apcode models installed

apcode models info <id>

apcode recommend

apcode benchmark
```

---

# ⌨️ Keyboard Controls

Inside the interactive TUI:

```text
Enter       Send request
Ctrl+C      Cancel operation
Ctrl+P      Commands
Tab         Switch agents
↑ / ↓       Navigate history
```

The interface is designed for keyboard-first development.

---

# 🧠 Models

APCode uses its model/runtime layer to work with available local models.

Example:

```text
ollama · Qwen2.5-Coder 7B Q4
```

If a model isn't available, APCode should tell you instead of pretending it is.

Example:

```text
⚠ No local model installed
```

Check models:

```bash
apcode models
```

Get a recommendation:

```bash
apcode recommend
```

---

# 📊 Hardware Benchmark

APCode includes a lightweight benchmark system to help understand your machine.

Run:

```bash
apcode benchmark
```

Example:

```text
APCode Benchmark

CPU
    7M ops/sec

Memory
    19K MiB/s

Runtime
    Native

Status
    Ready
```

This information can help guide local-model selection.

---

# 🔍 Project Awareness

Run APCode from inside your project:

```bash
cd my-project
apcode
```

APCode can detect project information such as:

```text
Language
Files
Git repository
Current branch
Working tree state
```

Example:

```text
Python · 24 files · Git: main
```

This gives the agent useful context before you ask it to work.

---

# 📋 Activity UI

When APCode performs work, operations are represented with semantic states:

```text
◐ Working
✓ Success
⚠ Warning
✗ Error
→ Action
```

Example:

```text
APCode

◐ Analyzing project...
✓ Project detected
✓ Found authentication files

◐ Reading src/auth/login.py
◐ Planning changes
◐ Editing src/auth/login.py

✓ File updated

◐ Running tests
✓ 18 tests passed
```

The important principle:

> **Activity should represent real operations — never fake tool calls.**

---

# 🎨 Responsive Terminal UI

APCode adapts to different terminal widths.

```text
< 80 columns
    Compact UI

80–119 columns
    Normal UI

≥ 120 columns
    Expanded UI
```

The goal is to keep the interface readable without overflowing the terminal.

---

# 🌈 No-Color Mode

APCode supports terminals where ANSI styling isn't desirable.

```bash
apcode --no-color
```

You can also use:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 apcode
```

The interface remains usable without relying on color.

---

# 🏗️ Architecture

APCode keeps the terminal interface separated from the core systems.

The TUI should remain responsible for presentation and interaction rather than business logic.

# 🔐 Design Philosophy

APCode is built around a few principles:

### Local-first

Your development environment should not depend entirely on cloud infrastructure.

### Lightweight

A coding agent shouldn't require a massive desktop application just to interact with your project.

### Transparent

The agent should clearly communicate what it is doing.

### Reliable

Visual effects are secondary to correct behavior.

### Developer-first

Keyboard shortcuts, terminal compatibility, readable output, and predictable commands matter.

---

# 🗺️ Roadmap

APCode is actively evolving.

Possible future improvements include:

```text
□ Better agent planning
□ Richer code intelligence
□ Improved diff visualization
□ More local model integrations
□ Improved model benchmarking
□ Agent/tool permissions
□ Session persistence
□ Better project indexing
□ More terminal themes
□ Plugin/extensibility system
```
